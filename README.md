### This project aims to:  
1. Collect data from a variety of sources (health, climate, geographic, 
demographic) openly available and focusing on the state of São Paulo, Brazil. 

2. Munge the data to a format suitable to be used for modeling and exploratory 
analisys.  

3. Use the data for modeling.The initial goal is to determine whether we can 
predict the location and severity of an outbreak. The focus area in the state of
São Paulo will be limited based on goals 1 and 2. Part of the data will be set 
aside to test the models.
